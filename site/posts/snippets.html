            November 16, 2015<br><br>
            It's been a long while since I've done a complete brain dump, but I've been thinking about a lot of things recently so it's time...<br>
            <br>
            <img src="musings/Post%20Photos/Misc/snippets.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="snippets">
            <br>
            First things first... got a new lens and I LOVE IT, get ready for more portraiture and ~~~artfully blurry pictures~~~ like the one above.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Entering my 20s with a bang and realizing that I still like Justin Bieber's music as much as I did when I was in my teens. Especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyEuk8j8imI">this song</a>. "My mama don't like you and she likes everyone // And I never like to admit that I was wrong." There have been many times I didn't want to hear what my parents were telling me about any number of things: bad people, bad situations, bad decisions. But they were always right. Sometimes you've just got to accept your parents know best.</strong><br>
            <br>
            I'm learning that in life you often have to choose between doing what is 100% right for you and doing something that is maybe 75% right for you, but will also make someone else happy, or nurture a relationship with someone else. And sometimes, you have to swallow your pride and choose the latter.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>In the last few months of trying to balance school / work / health I've put a lot of other things on the back-burner at the expense of those main three. It's taken a little while to realize that those parts of life don't necessarily add up to 100% every day, week, month or year. Personal happiness, friendships, family, mental well-being, and so much more also factor in... something I often forget.</strong><br>
            <br>
            The current "bug" infecting millennials involves holding back on our feelings at the expense of appearing too vulnerable, or indicating we care too much. As someone who thinks / talks / dreams / feels / hopes a little too much, this bug is hard to catch. Though I don't see myself donning a blas√© personality anytime soon, I think it's a valuable lesson to learn: sometimes holding back on SOME of the things you feel is okay. It doesn't hurt to wear only half of your heart on your sleeve.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>My newest goal is to stop being petty about things; probably my biggest flaw is acting childish when I feel slighted by someone. Rather than talking about what actually bothers me, I ignore people, or talk back like I'm legitimately five years old. More than it shows my complete lack of maturity, it doesn't actually solve anything, and it certainly doesn't make me any happier.</strong><br>
            <br>
            Thanks for sticking around to hear all that plagues me on an average day. HAPPY MONDAY!!!! May your week be merry.<br>
            <br>
            PS. Despite, and in light of, recent events that have left the world we live in shaken and confused, I decided posting some more serious thoughts on this blog was in order. Though it was not included in my snippets, to all those affected by the past few days of turmoil, and even beyond, you are always in my thoughts.
